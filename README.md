# Week 04: Full-Stack Microservice Deployment with Kubernetes

This example extends previous weeks' concepts by demonstrating the deployment of a multi-service application (frontend and three backend microservices) onto a local Kubernetes cluster, typically running via Docker Desktop. This setup provides hands-on experience with container orchestration, configuration management, and service discovery within a Kubernetes environment.
